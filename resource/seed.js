        "Captain's Personal Log, February 12, 2152. After a brief detour, we're back on course for Risa. Everyone's looking forward to some much needed shore leave. I've got my eye on a place called Suraya Bay, villas built right into the cliffs. A perfect spot to enjoy a few good books. Might even do a little diving when I…" (ENT: "Desert Crossing")
        "Captain's Personal Log, February 18, 2152. It took a while, but we've finally made it to Risa. With any luck, this'll be my last log entry for the next two days." (ENT: "Two Days and Two Nights")

        "Captain's personal log, stardate 1709.2. Per Captain Kirk's plan, we are mounting a pincer move. Our two ships will slowly drift closer as the Romulans remain unaware. When they pass through the comet's tail, giving us their exact location, we will be in weapons range. Kirk, however, has agreed to my plan to neutralize, not destroy, the Bird-of-Prey, leaving open the possibility of dialogue. And yet, I remain concerned this brash young Starfleet captain follows his own rules. I can't help but wonder: is Kirk the reason I was sent here? If I wasn't here to stop him, would we be led into a war?" (SNW: "A Quality of Mercy")`,

        "Captain's Personal Log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma 7A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Dr. McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge. Mr. Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress. Both are right, both are capable, and which of my friends do I condemn to death?" (TOS: "The Immunity Syndrome")`,

        "USS Enterprise, Captain's Personal Log. With most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home. Yet I feel uneasy, and I wonder why. Perhaps it is the emptiness of this vessel. Most of our trainee crew have been reassigned. Lieutenant Saavik and my son, David, are exploring the Genesis Planet, which he helped create. And Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone. No, more empty even than that. The death of Spock is like an open wound. It seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there… on that newborn planet." (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)`,

As soon as the major modifications are complete we'll reverse course and head back to the nebula. Though I've certainly had some strange experiences in my career, nothing quite compares to the sight of my future self briefing my officers on technology that hasn't been invented yet."
